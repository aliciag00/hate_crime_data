Main Conclusions:
- California has significantly higher rates of hate crime
- New York follows
- Both centers for diversity and inclusion

It is obvious that the outcasts of society are the people who suffer the most from the hate crimes that are committed in the United States. 
Transendentalist and the members of the Beat Generation tended to head to California or New York where they felt the most safe and comfortable to 
be themselves. Unfortunately upon arrival, they found that not everyone is so welcoming. Data shows that just in those two states about 70,0000 
victims have suffered through senseless crime. Celebrating the poets and artists, like we have done in this class, is so important because they 
deserve the recognition. Straying away from societal norms can be extremely challenging, and there will always be people who disagree with what you 
fully believe in. Spreading their message is what made all of the hardships and sacrifices worth it. I think that by analyzing and understanding the
work produced by the Transcendentalists and the Beat Poets, we are fulfilling their purpose of putting in the effort to write such influencial pieces.
